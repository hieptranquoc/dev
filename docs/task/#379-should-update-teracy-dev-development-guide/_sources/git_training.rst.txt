Git Training
============

Git is a distributed version control systems (DVCS) which was used to manange all Teracy's
development resources. You need to learn to use Git to work with Teracy's projects.

Studying
---------

There are many free available resources for you to study git. The followings are some recommended resources:

- http://git-scm.com/book

- http://sixrevisions.com/resources/git-tutorials-beginners/

- http://documentup.com/skwp/git-workflows-book

Practising
----------

- Prerequisites

    + You need to have a github account with configured ssh keys.

    + ``teracy-dev`` is running with working ssh (``$ ssh -T git@github.com`` should be ok).

- Git basics

    + You are going to create a ``pro-git-practice`` repository on github (via github's web UI).

    + The repository on your VM should be at ``workspace/personal/pro-git-practice``.

    + Read the chapter 2 and practice with your ``pro-git-practice`` repository on your VM at
      http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics.

    + Remember to push the changes to github so we could see your work and practice.


- Working again on teracy-tutorial

.. note::
    You are encouraged to practice with as many git commands as possible, but have to follow
    strictly all the instructions below, the results will be displayed on github to check.

As you remember, you practiced to adapt Django's tutorial into Teracy's ``Django boilerplate`` project.

Now you will continue to work on it with git and push it to github.

#. Initial setup:

    - Create your repository named ``teracy-tutorial`` on github, and set up the local repo ``   workspace/personal/teracy-tutorial`` on your VM.

    - Push this first commit on github (Initial setup).

#. Setting up project layout

    - Add the remote repository https://github.com/teracyhq/django-boilerplate.git into
      your repository with the ``djbp`` name.

    - Fetch and merge the ``djbp/master`` branch.

    - Push the merge to your github's repository at ``origin/master``.

#. Tutorial 01 at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/.
