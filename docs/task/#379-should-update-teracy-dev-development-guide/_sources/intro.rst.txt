Introduction
============

Welcome to ``teracy-dev`` - the starting point to learn to join Teracy team.

We, Teraciers, believe that development experience is really important. That's the reason why we care and make
sure our development environment must be consistent, smooth, and easy to set up. We do not have to
spend too much time for installing tons of development packages one by one, we want that setup
process must be automated.

And this ``teracy-dev`` repository was created for that purpose, to make sure working at Teracy with
ease and fun. We are using ``virtualbox`` for running isolated virtual machines, ``chef`` and
``vagrant`` for installing and configuring any necessary packages automatically.

We work intensively on this documentation so that anyone, who wants to join us, has to pass the
training program by following the documentation instructions. The documentation will guide you steps
by steps to set up working environment, to learn our toolchain, workflow, and our development
culture.

entertaining, etc."

meanings to the name.
